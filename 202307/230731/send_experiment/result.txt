error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s`
  --> src/main.rs:10:24

9  |         tx.send(s).unwrap();
   |                 - value moved here

   |                        ^ value borrowed here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `s` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
